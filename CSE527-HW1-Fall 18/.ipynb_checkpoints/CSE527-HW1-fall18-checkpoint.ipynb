    "- **Problem 1 Gaussian convolution {20 pts}:** Write a function in Python that takes two arguments, a width parameter and a variance parameter, and returns a 2D array containing a Gaussian kernel of the desired dimension and variance. The peak of the Gaussian should be in the center of the array. Make sure to normalize the kernel such that the sum of all the elements in the array is 1. Use this function and the OpenCVâ€™s `filter2D` routine to convolve the lena and lena_noise arrays with a 5 by 5 Gaussian kernel with sigma of 1. Repeat with a 11 by 11 Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 3. There will be four output images from this problem, namely, lena convolved with 3x3, 11x11, lena_noise convolved with 3x3, and 11x11. Once you fill in and run the codes, the outputs will be saved under Results folder. These images will be graded based on the difference with ground truth images. You might want to try the same thing on other images but it is not required. Include your code and results in your Jupyter Notebook file."

Getting the histogram of a grayscale image is incredibly easy with python. A histogram is a vector of numbers. Once you have the histogram, you can get the cumulative distribution function (CDF) from it. Then all you have left is to find the mapping from each value [0,255] to its adjusted value (just using the CDF basically). **DO NOT** use cv2.equalizeHist() directly to solve the exercise! We will expect to see in your code that you get the PDF and CDF, and that you manipulate the pixels directly (avoid a for loop, though).
